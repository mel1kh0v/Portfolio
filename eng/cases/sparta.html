                        <li class="task">User frustration and errors resulting from a poorly designed online booking system.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="description">Additionally, a thorough analysis of competitor websites uncovered several noteworthy aspects, including strengths, weaknesses, and untapped opportunities.</p>
                    <h4>Advantages:</h4>
                    <ul>

                        <li class="task">Inconsistent or outdated class schedules and availability of open spots;</li>
                        <li class="task">Confusing or unintuitive user interface;</li>
                        <li class="task">Low-quality visual content, including images;</li>
                        <li class="task">Other disadvantages;</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Unrealized opportunities:</h4>
                    <ul>

                    </ul>
                    <p class="description">Using the Customer Journey Map (CJM) was crucial in ensuring that the final design successfully meets the needs and expectations of the target audience. By creating a comprehensive CJM, I was able to visually map out the entire client journey, starting from the initial awareness stage all the way to their decision to join the club. This allowed me to identify and analyze the pain points and potential areas for improvement throughout the entire process.</p>

                    <p class="description">This enabled me to create a website that puts the user at the center and prioritize features and content that enhance the overall user experience, ultimately motivating visitors to take action. In today's digital landscape, the utilization of CJM has emerged as a crucial tool in achieving project goals and designing a successful website.</p>
                    <p class="description">By leveraging the insights provided by the Customer Journey Map (CJM), I gained a deeper understanding of the user's needs, pain points, and motivations throughout their journey on the website. This holistic view allowed me to identify key touchpoints and optimize them to align with the user's expectations, thereby improving their overall satisfaction and engagement.</p>
