                        <h3>Project Background</h3>
                        <p class="description">"Bakery on Petrogradskaya" is a new bakery located in the heart of Petrogradsky District, St. Petersburg. With its wide range of delicious and freshly baked goods, the bakery has gained a loyal customer base over the years. To expand its reach and enhance customer experience, "Petrogradskaya" has decided to embark on a website development project to create an enticing and user-friendly online platform.</p>

                        <p class="description">The project aimed to develop a visually appealing and user-friendly website that effectively represented the bakery's brand identity and showcased its wide range of products.</p>
                        <p class="description">Throughout the design process, my primary focus was on creating a user-friendly interface that would engage and guide site visitors, encouraging them to explore the bakery's offerings and ultimately make a purchase.</p>

                <h2>Case Study</h2>
                <h3>UX Research</h3>
                <p class="description">To initiate my research, I began by crafting a persona using the data acquired during user interviews. This persona served as a representative archetype, enabling me to better understand the needs, preferences, and behaviors of the target audience.</p>
                <p class="description">This process of creating a persona provided valuable insights, highlighting the significance of certain factors to users. It revealed that users highly value the convenience of placing orders from the comfort of their homes, the assurance of secure financial transactions during the payment process, and the availability of detailed information about the nutritional value of the products. Armed with this understanding, I was able to prioritize and address these key user concerns in the design and functionality of the website.</p>
                <span onclick="openPopup('../../resourses/images/cases/petrogradskaya/persona.png')"><img src="../../resourses/images/cases/petrogradskaya/persona.png" alt="" width="100%" height="auto"></span>
                    
                    <!--Pop-up-->

                    <div id="popup" class="popup" onclick="closePopup(event)">
                        <div class="close-btn" onclick="closePopup(event)"></div>
                        <img id="popupImage" src="" alt="" onclick="closePopup(event)">
                    </div>
                    
                <p class="description">Next, I proceeded to create a user flow diagram that provides a detailed visualization of the main path a client takes from their initial visit to the website to completing a purchase. Additionally, the diagram encompasses an alternate path for scenarios where the user's intent or purpose of the search is unknown. This comprehensive diagram allows for a clear understanding of the user journey and helps ensure a seamless and intuitive experience for users, regardless of their specific needs or goals.</p>

                <p class="description">I also created a customer journey map, which helped me understand the motivation and desires of potential users, identify problems they may encounter in advance and solve them in advance.</p>
                <span onclick="openPopup('../../resourses/images/cases/petrogradskaya/cjm.jpg')"><img src="../../resourses/images/cases/petrogradskaya/cjm.jpg" alt="" width="100%" height="auto"></span>

            </div>
            <div class="container-small">
                <h3>Final Design</h3>
                <p class="description">The website has been adorned with a warm and inviting design that aligns harmoniously with the brand's corporate identity. It boasts a minimalistic aesthetic, focusing on simplicity and elegance. The site's structure has been thoughtfully organized to ensure ease of use, allowing users to effortlessly navigate and accomplish their desired tasks.</p>
                <p class="description">The main page of the website showcases the bakery's most popular products, provides a brief history of the establishment, and features customer reviews. This strategic approach aims to build trust and loyalty among potential customers by highlighting the bakery's reputation and positive feedback from satisfied patrons.</p>
                <img src="../../resourses/images/cases/petrogradskaya/homepage.jpg" alt="" width="70%" height="auto">
                <p class="description">The internal sections, such as "About Me" and "Catering," offer valuable information about the bakery, its products, and the range of services provided. These sections serve as informative resources, allowing visitors to learn more about the bakery's background, values, and specialties. Additionally, they provide insights into the various products and services available, assisting customers in making informed decisions and further engaging with the bakery.</p>
                <span onclick="openPopup('../../resourses/images/cases/petrogradskaya/main-pages.jpg')"><img src="../../resourses/images/cases/petrogradskaya/main-pages.jpg" alt="" width="100%" height="auto"></span>
                <p class="description">The user is presented with comprehensive details about each product, encompassing information such as the composition, nutritional value, shelf life, and reviews from other customers. This level of detail allows users to make informed choices based on their preferences, dietary requirements, and the experiences of previous customers. By providing such thorough product information, the bakery aims to enhance transparency and facilitate a confident and satisfactory purchase experience for its customers.</p>
                <p class="description">The shopping cart page showcases the products that have been added by the user, providing a clear overview of their selections. Additionally, a section featuring enticing offers is included, encouraging users to consider adding additional products to their basket. This strategic placement of interesting offers serves to increase the user's engagement and potentially boost their purchase value, while ensuring a seamless and convenient checkout process.</p>
                <span onclick="openPopup('../../resourses/images/cases/petrogradskaya/order-flow.jpg')"><img src="../../resourses/images/cases/petrogradskaya/order-flow.jpg" alt="" width="100%" height="auto"></span>
                <p class="description">To enhance the user experience, I have streamlined the ordering process, making it simple and convenient for users by minimizing the number of required fields to fill in. Users are only required to provide or select the delivery address, recipient's details, and choose a preferred payment method. This approach reduces friction and ensures a smooth and efficient checkout process, ultimately contributing to a positive user experience.</p>
